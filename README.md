LinkHub is a resource management web application. It allows users to save and organize web resources (links) in repositories.      

Linkhub is still under development. Three major parts of it have to be developed  
* LinkHub REST API 
* LinkHub Web application
* LinkHub chrome extension

The LinkHub REST API is done and can be used. For more details on how to interact with LinkHub API you can visit the <a href=https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29464988/2s9YXiaMvk>LinkHub REST API Documentation</a>     

LinkHub web application and LinkHub chrome extension are yet to be developed :)

## About LinkHub
### What is LinkHub and who is it for?
LinkHub is a resource management application which allows users to save and organize web resources in LinkHub repositories.   
### Where do you save your web resources?
Are you someone who uses the web in your daily basis? Do you visit a lot of websites? Do you have a place to organize and save the links to the website you visit for your future reference or just share with a friend in one link?  
If you answered yes to any of those questions then LinkHub is for you. You will easily save your web resources in related repositories to visit later or share with other people you wish to save the trouble of searching the all over the web to get the resources you have already found.   

For instance, let's say you wish to save all your favorite blogs in one place, or you wish to save all the links about cooking, sports, a programming topic or simply any topic in one place. First you will create a repository with a name related to the resources you wish to save, then you will add all the related links in that repository as resources. Next time you need to review the topic, you won't have to go back into your bookmarks or searching all over again to find them, you will simply go to your LinkHub account, find the repository you need and visit the resources you wish to visit, click on them and you will be redirected to the resource website.
