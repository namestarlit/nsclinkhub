This module defines a repository class for organizing and managing resources.

In the LinkHub application, the 'Repository' class allows users to create,
manage, and organize collections of resources, such as links or references.
Users can create repositories, assign them relevant names
(e.g., 'Game Development,' 'Machine Learning'), and group related resources
within them.

Key Features:
- Creation and management of repositories to organize resources.
- Repository names provide meaningful categorization (e.g., 'Web Development,' 'Data Science').
- Resources can be associated with specific repositories.
- Supports efficient organization and retrieval of resources.

Usage Example:
1. Create a repository for 'Game Development.'
2. Add links to game development tutorials and resources to the repository.
3. Quickly access and manage all game development-related resources from one location.
