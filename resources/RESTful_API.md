Handling errors in a RESTful API requires a balance between user-friendliness
and providing meaningful information to the client.
Here are some common practices for error handling in RESTful APIs:

1. Use Appropriate HTTP Status Codes:
   - Use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the result of the request. For example:
     - 200 OK: Successful request.
     - 201 Created: Resource created successfully.
     - 204 No Content: Request processed successfully with no response body.
     - 400 Bad Request: Client error due to invalid input.
     - 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required or authentication failed.
     - 403 Forbidden: The client does not have permission to access the resource.
     - 404 Not Found: Resource not found.
     - 405 Method Not Allowed: HTTP method not supported for the resource.
     - 500 Internal Server Error: Generic server error.
   - Choose the appropriate status code based on the nature of the error. For example,
     use 400 for malformed requests and 403 for permission-related errors.

2. Provide Clear Error Messages:
   - Include a meaningful error message in the response body to help clients understand the issue.
     The error message should be user-friendly and informative.
   - Avoid exposing internal server details in error messages for security reasons.

3. Use Consistent Error Structure:
   - Define a consistent error structure for your API responses.
     For example, you can use a common format like JSON:
     ```json
     {
       "error": {
         "code": 403,
         "message": "You don't have permission to access this resource."
       }
     }
     ```

4. Avoid Stack Traces:
   - Don't expose stack traces or detailed internal error information to clients.
     Provide only information that helps users identify the issue.

5. Handle Common Error Scenarios:
   - Handle common error scenarios with specific status codes.
     For example, if a client sends an invalid token, you can return a 401 Unauthorized.
     If the client sends a malformed request (e.g., missing parameters), return a 400 Bad Request.

6. Version Your API:
   - Consider adding versioning to your API. This allows you to make changes to error handling
     and response structures without breaking existing clients.

7. Implement Authentication and Authorization:
   - Use proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to differentiate
     between authentication failures (401) and authorization failures (403).
     For example, if a user tries to delete a resource they don't own, return 403 Forbidden.
     If a user is not authenticated, return 401 Unauthorized.

8. Consider Rate Limiting:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your API.
     Return a 429 Too Many Requests status code when a client exceeds the rate limit.

In the case of handling tokens, you might consider returning a 401 Unauthorized
if the token is invalid or missing, and return a 400 Bad Request if the token format is incorrect.
This approach provides clear feedback to the client while distinguishing between authentication issues
and other client errors.

The key is to make error responses as informative as possible while maintaining security
and adhering to RESTful API standards.
